## Warning!

Due to the current mix that is happening between some matrix servers with Authenticated media enabled and others not, the official browser version of the Pony House is with Authenticated media enabled by default and an optional new configuration has been added for users to enable or disable both in the settings tab, both on the page.

If the images are not loading correctly, you just need to disable the Authenticated media in the `Security` setting's tab.
