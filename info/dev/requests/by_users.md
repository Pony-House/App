@Tiny Jasmini do u think u could make it so broken images for space icons fall back to the default colored icons for spaces without images set? preferably change it to show the first letter of the space's name?
if media breaks then having just a list of identical broken image icons makes things difficult

btw would it be possible to enable re-ordering the emoji packs in the picker?
like maybe add grab handles in the settings in the emoji tab?
currently it's just ordered by when u clicked the "use globally" checkbox for each pack

Buttons in the picture viewer to go to the next/previous image in the chat

==============================================================

also i wonder if u could put somewhere in the settings a count of the number of rooms and spaces ur "subscribed" to?

that could be useful for future diagnostics

=======================================

would it be possible to change the order embeds load in? so the most recents messages get their embeds loaded first?

those would be more important than the older embeds
