# Web3 Mods

This folder is dedicated to all the Pony House web3 content.

I am migrating all web3 scripts to this folder to turn the web3 script into a mod content. (I will remove web3 from the root app)

At the moment it is only safe for you to disable web3 scritps through the ".env" file, but when this migration is complete, you can uninstall everything by just deleting this folder.
